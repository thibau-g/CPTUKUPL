            <p>Your first day at school is always daunting. Especially when you're not great at making friends. It's 
            just a shame I met my kind of people 7 months in. My now best friend Harrison taught me to play poker and,
            for the whole of Year 13 we played. We would get to school early and play a game to ease us into the day. 
            Everytime we went to eachothers' houses whether it be to bum around or for a reason we would make time for a 
            game. We spoke poker, we watched poker, we did the maths. Come exams, we weren't bad players. Until then, we 
            never played competitively against eachother, and finally we decided to keep score of who won each game. He 
            won twice, then I won, then he, then I. It came to 7 all and I finally overtook him, soon enough he regained 
            the lead. He had mastered a mathematical approach whilst I played the psychology, and we were as good as one 
            another. 
            
            </br></br> Come the first week of September, I had to move to London to start at my University and he left to 
            Surrey Uni. I'm not one to miss much, whether it be my family or bedroom or other things most people miss. 
            There were only 2 things I came to miss. My dog Summit and our endless poker games. 
        
            </br></br>Surrey Univesrity has 80 players, Pearson College London (my uni) didn't have a team. So I made one, 
            with the aim or rivalling Surrey, partly to see who's uni has the best players, but also to get to play 
            against him again. I thought the idea of rivalling other Universities would be interesting, and found no
            UK University Poker League. So if you think you have what it takes, or know someone who might, join!</p>
